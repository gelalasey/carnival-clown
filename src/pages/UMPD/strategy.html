			<p>please note: this game uses a lot of RNG, there is no 100% gauranteed way to get the exact result you're looking for. Strategies will vary from trainer to trainer and there's no wrong way to run an uma if it works! These are my strategies based on my own research, I hope they work for you but they may not. Enjoy making your own track to victory! </p>

                <h2>How to Win at Uma</h2>
            <p>First things first: you need to know your objective. Are you trying to earn carats by unlocking the perfect ending? Are you training a future parent? Do you need a new member for team trials? While TP is limited, it's a renewable resource that regenerates everyday. You don't want to get caught up in trying to do everything at once, solve one problem at a time. </p>    
              
        <h3>Winning the Race</h3>        
        <p>For an easy win you'll want to stick to story cannon as much as possible. That means if your girl is a natural front runner for the mile with a 20% boost in speed and 10% in wit, that pretty much gives you direction on how you'd build that deck. I find the story of the URA tends to conicide pretty well with delivering extra status boosters to the area they intend for that uma. </p>    
        <b>URA stats can be lower than stats needed for winning team trials</b><p>I didn't understand this at first, but essentially the threshhold is lower when you play only against the computer. The normal threshhold for stamina is lowered by 400 points. So apply this to the stamina chart when determining minimum stamina.</p>   
        
        <h3>Winning PVP</h3>
        <p>This is where I find you can get more creative. For team trials you want to make sure each Uma on your team has a different running style (they get point bonuses for this). Thinking outside the box can allow you to utilize their strengths in a new way. I've got guides on what I plan to do with each uma on their specific page but some common examples are running Sakura as a front runner to use her need for speed or upping nice natures wit up to turn her into the debuffer from hell (Naughty Nature). </p>        
    <h2>What stats do I need?</h2>    
    <h3>Minimum Stamina </h3>            
    <p>If you don't have the stamina you will die. Think of stamina as your HP, and every step you take is like damage taken. You can buff your way to make the damage less but if you don't have enough to withstand the onslaught you won't survive.</p>

     <h4>htw does dirt factor into this?</h4>         
<p>Dirt requires an extra amount of power to push through the track (about 50-100 points). It's usually not classified as it's own race becuase the distances will vary - typically in URA and team trials dirt is a mile distance. </p>
    
    <h3>Speed and Power</h3>
        <p>Again, training is personal but here are the stats I aim for. Remember as a beginner, if you can't hit these numbers try to hit the ratios instead. (1000, 600, 600 is 5:3:3)</p>   <h4>Speed and Power MINIMUMS</h4> 
                <table>
            <tr>
                <th>race distance</th>

                <td>long</td>
                <td>750</td>
                <td>600</td>
                </tr>  
                
                </table>    
                
                
        <h3>wb wit and guts?</h3>        
            <p>While most of the minimum stats have been build around distance, this one i tend to focus more on strategy. But here's the basics of it</p>  
            <p><b>Guts</b> this is irrelevant, even if Tazuna tells you you need more to win the race. just hit 400 in your ult build and you're golden</p> 
            <p><b>Wit</b> The more wit you have the more likely your stats will activate, but after a certain number the return on investment in points is moot. At 600 you will have a 85% chance of activating...but for 300 more points you'll only have a 90% chance of activating. It's not worth going beyond 600 really for this reason. Even a perfect 1200 will only net you a 92.5% occurance rate.</p>
