            <p>if there's one thing to know about me its that I never <i>ever</i> watch animes live. the one acception to this has been one piece and it's bc my partner refuses to let me read the manga and get ahead of him. </p>
            <p><b>i am a binge watcher by nature</b> and i cannot function with week to week waiting periods. i already lived through this back in the days of live tv. i am too adhd to even remember what happened 1 hour ago so forget about a whole week inbetween. I watch shows once they've been proven popular and enjoyable and have concluded at least a full season. otherwise i'm just setting myself up for a bad time.</p>
            
            <i>i am ashamed to admit how many anime i have all together just stopped watching because i only got access to like 4 episodes and forgot that shit existed.</i>
            
            <p>so when you're asking yourself why is this dude still talking about anime that came out 5, 10, 15 years ago...you are being abelist and the park security will take you to theme park jail (it is the ball pit with zip ties on the doors)</p>

            <p>I will fight someone to the death who claims that subs are always better than dubs. I get that was a real consistent thing back in like *checks watch* 2009... but now that capitalism realizes they can make money off of anime fans and increase their audience size I think dubs have grown to become more entertaining. </p>

                <h3>best character</h3>
                <p>truly so hard to narrow down, there really wasn't a character I actively disliked. they all did a good job bringing the story along and having a decent addition to the plot. </p>
                <h4>Runner up: yugiri the legendary courtesan</h4>
                <div class="flexbox">        
                    <div><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6483b93109b75579f432bcfecafaba79/5fd6d89d1cd28277-16/s640x960/c7eb29fae7552708399305123eed03f9b4a3d5bd.jpg" style="width:200px"></div>
                    <div><p>I think a lot of this had to do with the fact that her english va is stephanie young...but genuinely she is an excellent character. I loved so many of her one liners, her voice is juicy delicious, and her backstory is hella interesting to the lore.</p></div>
                </div>
                <h4>winner: kotaro</h4>
                <p>oh big suprise i pick the one boy character. and no it's really not just because I am crying laughing at half of his dialogue. he feels like the first p-chan in an idol anime that wasn't just a dopey dude overwhelmed by the beautiful idol with slightly better grounding in reality. he was flawed, he was passionate, he was a real person. He cared about his girls and his hometown. </p>
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/drunkenanimeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018-11-03_18-58-04.png?resize=640%2C356&ssl=1">
                <p> but also he is a big funny yell man</p>

                <h3>best song</h3>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KXOGtK8SNB0?si=arPoKqCcI-B1N5EE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>read these lyrics and tell me you're not hyped up as hell about this group. I think this was the perfect start to s2 and has just the most beautiful imagery. while i know not everyone dug the dubbed music - this one song i wish would have made the cut. in fact, one day i might do my own fan translation of it because i just want it so badly. </p>
