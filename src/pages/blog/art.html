            <h2 id="minigarden">the mini garden</h2>
            <p>my second original miniature build is one of many i plan to make in a series for my lol dolls. in order to curb my impulses to keep buying those little gatcha balls that are soooo satisfying to unwrap, i made myself promise that each doll would get her own little room for a larger dollhouse i plan to build. The garden was the first one because i got the <b>perfect</b> green box base to put them in. </p>
            <details class="readmore">
                <summary>read more</summary>
                <h3>the plan</h3>
               
            
                <p>there were a few things i knew needed to exist in this build.</p>
                <div class="box">
                <div><ul> <li>A nursery: I'd gotten my hands on some cute potted plants from the mini brands <a href="Make It Mini Lifestyle Home Series">Make It Mini Lifestyle Home Series</a>. I was hoping to get something more indoors but the gatcha gods said fate had something else in mind.</li>
        <li>A proper garden: I'd picked up some cute veggies and mushrooms i knew i wanted to use</li>
        <li>A supply shed (for the dolls tools) </li></ul>
                    <p>Originally I'd also thought about including a horse shelter. I'd gotten a random horse toy along the way, but over the course of building I nixed that and turned the whole thing into the shed.</p>
           </div>
                <div> <img src="/blog/images/art/20230422_140632.jpg"></div>
                </div>
           
            
            <p>Lastly I knew i wanted to use as much natural elements as I could, but keep it true to LOL and not get into gritty realism. At the time I'd been watching a lot of DnD builders making cool fake dirt and wanted something similar... but I also had a lot of leftover green turf from my first cafe set build.</p>
                <hr>
            <h3>the base</h3>    
            
            <p>i accidentally ended up spending way too much time in the beginning for what ended up showing - but to keep my environment feeling nature based but also synthetic I wanted to make part of the flooring from a puzzle I was gifted. my mom likes to do a lot of puzzles based off impressionism because of the challenge.... not me though. I'm very bad at telling the different blobs apart. It was a great idea to upcycle it this way... but putting together a fraction of the puzzle to get to where i could use it in the build.... was ... impressively long</p> 
            <p><b>but let's move past that</b></p>    
            <div class="box">   
            <div><img src="/blog/images/art/gardenwip1.webp">  </div>  
          <div> <p>once i got a workable section of puzzle to glue to the bottom of the box I covered the edges with the turf scraps I'd saved. I was able to make a lot of natural holes and curves just from the shape of the scraps. But how to blend it all together?</p> </div>
            </div> 
             <p>This next part was clearly inspired by my youtube search history. Using some spackling i layed a foundation to add more grit and natural elements. I collected some dirt outside and pressed it in over the super obvious holes and cracks. I think I added some modge podge over the grass and puzzle pieces to give it a lighter dust as well. i dont remember, I did this ages ago. next time i'll take better notes. </p>

              <h3>the shed</h3>  
                <div><img src="/blog/images/art/garden2.jpg"></div>
                <p>The largest piece for this build was a garden shed (formerly intended to be a horse barn). I frankensteined this structure out of a jewelry box container, leftover ply wood, and cardboard. I used cereal boxes to create the shingles and added a nice white dry brush over them to make it look a little more rustic. You can see on the side where I glued random plywood to make a garden workbench and little shelves. Did I mention this was the first time I learned about dry brushing this craft?</p>
                <h3>the little details</h3>
