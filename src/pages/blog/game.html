    <p>gatcha is a scam. we used to just pay a base amount of a game and got to play with all the pieces either immediately or gauranteed through play time. why pay money for something that doesn't even exist. just make your own art.</p>
    <p>look....i know...and yet...i fell for it..</p>
    <p>i spent....<s>redacted</s> dollars i didn't have for pixels in a hello kitty furniture and fashion idle game. i had no business getting invested in this game as much as i did. there was like...zero game play, just collecting pixels.</p>
    <p>it may not have been my best moment...but i did get all these cute pics out of it</p>

                <p>there was a lot of socializing build into the game which made it fun to play. you could host little parties and participate in the in-game forums. I love when games make it so that the fandom interaction can happen on the app itself. I know censoring can become an issue but like...it's a game about hello kitty. the lore wasn't that deep.</p></div></div>

        <p>trading was a huge part of the game, which is refreshing when most gatcha force you to suffer with whatever you pull. albeit this game's gatcha rate overall was brutally expensive. so win some lose some?</p></div>

            <div class="flexbox">
            
            <p>Any time there's gatcha the completionist in me gets SUPER competitive. I just want to finish them all. and i'll be real - that's the main reason why i had to quit the game. i couldn't enjoy the gradual collection and the slower nature of the game.... although one could argue the predatory financial angel WAS one of the intentional aspects of the game... but that's just one man's opinion</p>  
            </div>
        <div class="flexbox">
        <div><p>the prices overall were insane. it cost about 1050 coins per pull and each pull was 7 or 8 items (can't remember) which is already below the standard 10. Not only was it way more to whale for full sets in this game (which came out to roughly 30 items). </p></div><div> <img src="/blog/images/game/hsd1.jpg" alt="Image 1"></div></div>
        <p>If you had perfect luck it would still take you about 4-5 pulls to get everything. And chances are you <b>wont</b> be that ungodly lucky. While the trading did make getting dupes not as terrible, if no one wanted them you were sol. </p>
        <p>the last gripe I had about prices were about the loyalty program. like other gatcha, you got ranked for how much you spent with irl money. So if you were a higher level you got access to more items, exclusive gatcha, things of that nature. We love loyalty programs! But what was infuriating was that it <b>reset every month</b> So if you spent 10 bucks in Oct and 10 bucks in Nov, you'd still wouldn't make the 20 buck tier. the whale level expected for this game was batshit.</p>

    <h3>my overall ranking</h3>
    <p>If 5 is best game ever and 1 is i did play that...I'd put this squarely at a 2. Not the greatest game ever and I dont think I could ever get back into it... but I really enjoyed it while I was there. It captured my adhd heart for those few months and helped me learn a lot more about the sanrio franchise. I even "made new friends"... not with people... with the mascots I mean. I found new ones I didn't know about that have become new favorites. </p>

                        <h3>about:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Gakuen Idolmaster (referred to in fandom as gakumas) is the perfect combination of my two
                            favorite tropes in animes - school life and idols. Here you a student at Hatsuboshi Gakuen,
                            a school for future idols and producers to grow their skills. As a student on the producer
                            track you need to scout potential talent and grow them towards success. it's pretty much a
                            roguelite raising sim with cute idol girls. Very similar to gameplay mechanics of idolly
                            pride or uma musume.
                        </p>
                        <h3>why i recommend it:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Because this is my dream scenario of academia, focus on trainee life, and genuinely
                            enjoyable characters. in past imas games i felt like the overflow of idols led to some
                            becoming so one dimensional there was no fun in getting to know them (looking at you
                            <a href="https://project-imas.wiki/Noriko_Shiina">Noriko the donut idol</a>)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            while note all the girls are my favorite, their personality and history ties directly into
                            the game play. The weak and sickly idol has a lower HP, the former ballerina scores higher
                            in dance than other areas, the sleepy idol stores up all her boosts for one final point
                            score at the end. it really makes you feel like you are producing them in a way that best
                            suits their personalitites.
                        </p>

                    <h2 id="underrated">my top underrated games in my library</h2>
                    <p>
                        what makes a game underrated? if everyone you know is playing it then isn't anyone who matters
                        playing it? if it's got a large enough player base that prevents the game from getting shut down
                        servers is it successful? let's not worry about the specific. for this list I'm going through my
                        favorite games in my steam library that have under 50k positive reviews. For reference games
                        like Stardew Valley are currently sitting at over 700k positive reviews. These can also count as

                            i played this originally on switch and would recommend this as opposed to going mobage, it
                            is way too time gated for my liking. just pay the $X upfront and be happy in the long run. I
                            spent untold hours satisfyingly coloring in my map, gathering materials and befriending the
                            sweetest bear ghosts.

                            You play as a spirit scout whose on a mission to earn badges and make this island a cute and
                            habitable place. The stories of the npcs were really sweet but with like a nice somber
                            twist. they're all <i>dead</i> remember? unlike other cozy sims this avoids the traditional
                            farming set up in favor of developing an overgrown wild island. there is so much freedom
                            when it comes to decoration and placement, but also good direction to place items that
                            satisfy and match the preferences of nearby ghosties. oh and the music *chefs kiss*

                        <p>
                            if you like child raising sims, this is your game. if you like learning about other
                            cultures, this is your game. if you like match 3 games and satisfying popping animations,
                            <i>this is your game</i>. Culturally i can't common on how realistically the game portrays
                            chinese childhood...seeing as I'm not Chinese. But the developers are chinese and the game
                            was originally written in chinese. What's even cooler is that in game you can answer surveys
                            about whether or not you experienced a similar scenario in your childhood.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You start the game as a literal infant and have to gain the skills you need to become a
                            model child and high scorer on the culturally infamous gaokao exam. You earn skills in
                            different areas to unlock differnt outcomes for your future including careers, spouses, and
                            parenting styles for when you raise the next generation. I spent hours trying to find all
                            the possible combinations and was not disappointed.

                            ok i know if you got this far i've definitely got some idol lovers out there who want a more
                            immersive idol sim. as much as i love mobage out there with wonderful idols i've come to
                            love, i wanted a game where i could build their entire image from scratch. and i was not
                            disappointed.

                            You are the manager of a brand new idol company with some not at all seedy benefactors
                            behind the scenes. You name the groups. You hire the girls. You pick the songs, styles,
                            promotions, everything. <s>you can also date the idols if you're into that...</s> This game
                            did a good job trying to recreate a lot of the dark issues that arise in the idol industry
                            without being too fan servicey about it. They walk a fine line soemtimes
                            <s
                                >remember i said you can date the idols...that you manage...in a power

                            >. But you can also completely ignore that aspect of the game. Which I do. I'm here to make
                            money ladies, not date. let's get focused.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's not for everyone, but it is extremely flexible and mod friendly (with lots of wardrobe
                            and character sprite updates). it really lets you play however you want and gives you lots
                            of fun scenarios to manage.

                            i found this game one day by skimming through games in the kawaii tag. i wasn't sure it was
                            going to be a good fit, the graphics were a bit too gritty looking for me at first. but then
                            i gave it a shot and was not disappointed.

                        <p>
                            this game plays half as a restaurant sim and half as a life sim. If you liked wandering the
                            streets of tokyo in persona 5 i think you will enjoy this game. the side scroller layout is
                            really different and fun. the world is cute and pixelated. it really feels like you live in
                            the heart of akibahara. my biggest critique of the game is wishing there was a bit more in
                            terms of customizing your mc. aaaand i didn't finish the game because i started it right
                            before a different game i wanted to play came out. But that doesn't mean
                            <i>you</i> shouldn't play it. finish it and tell me to get back into it.

                            im going to date myself so hard but i dont care if it means i convince you to try out the
                            nancy drew series. very few people remember this game coming out in the early 2000s, but i
                            do. my neighbor convinced me to go to target and buy the physical c.d.s (as you did back in
                            the stone age). I started playing secret of the scarlet hand and was hooked since.

                            you're nancy drew and you're here in this point and click story to solve a mystery. you
                            interview suspects, solve puzzles, and perform chores that are completely inappropriate most
                            of the time for a teenage guest on vacation but who cares about child labor laws when there
                            could be <i>g..g...gg...ghosts!</i> Each game is set in different cities and you get to
                            learn a lot of fun facts about history, science, culture, and more than you ever wanted to
                            know about morse code (somehow it always gets in there).

                            There are so many different stories you can choose from, each with great replay value that
                            streamers are still playing these games over for dozens of times. My top recs are Warnings
                            at Waveryly Academy for the dark academia girlies, Haunting of Castle Malloy for the whimsy
                            goths, and the final scene for some jump scares that still get me.
