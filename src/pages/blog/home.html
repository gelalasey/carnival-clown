            <p>ignore the html, this is not a blog. this is the <b>park newsletter</b> and my main goal here is to create a micro collection of all my writings, reviews, recaps, and recommendations. each area of the park represents a different interest of mine. If you get lost, don't worry. Your friendly neighborhood theme park owner has you covered</p>

            <h2 id="doll-museum">i went to a dollhouse museum</h2>
            <p>a while ago i went to the <a href="https://toyandminiaturemuseum.org/">national museum of toys and miniatures</a> in kansas city, mo. this was during my arduous 24+ bus ride from hell (more on that never) and i was surprised this gem existed. it's got a great combination of both nostalgia and history. let's just get straight to the goods. </p>

                <h3>Playsets i drool over</h3>
                <p>there's two main sections in this museum - toys and miniatures. I'm going to start with the colorful cute playsets that fit best with this blog, as we go on it's going to get more muted in color pallet if that offends your clownish sensibilities. usually it does for me but this park owner knows art when he sees it. </p>

               </div>
                <p> I am fascinated with the toyline of Liddle Kiddles (despite the unfortunate name) These were from the 1960s by Mattel Japan and every one of their names have to have “iddle” in it. They make me think of retro LOL dolls in terms of size and playstyle. I don’t think I would go out of my way to collect them, but they were fun to learn about. The perfume bottle is an example of the related lines like Kola Kiddles (in soda bottles), Kiddle Kologne,  and hauntingly drawn eyes on the jewelry. The Kolas are honestly cute enough I’d think about getting them maybe. </p>
